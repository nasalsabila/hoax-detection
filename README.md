# CekDulu - Is it a hoax or true information?

The information detection process, including distinguishing between hoaxes and truth, is built using the IndoBERT model. The achieved accuracy is approximately 97%. If the prediction is labeled as a hoax, a second prediction is performed for a more detailed hoax classification. The level 2 classification model for hoaxes utilizes NBSVM. The detailed misclassification/hoax classification is not applied to all categories due to the consideration of the number of data records.

The prediction results consist of the class/label and its probability.
